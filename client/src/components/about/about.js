						<p className="header body gap about-three">My passion for <strong>programming</strong> started around late
							2011, while I was
							playing with Adobe Dreamweaver, but then it got boring, as I wanted to know the basics of programming
							comprehensively. Shortly after I found love with <strong>Java</strong>, and then, the web came back to me
							from the simplicity
							of this language, since I've familiarised myself with the stacks of the <strong>internet</strong>, I had
							no reason to look back,
							it's been fun till now.</p>
