## Adeleke Adeniji's Profile Website

This is my second approach at designing my personal web profile, the first at [Code Surge](https://eazylaykzy.github.io/codesurge/), Code Surge happens to be a name I coined for myself, this new redesign was built on top of React JS [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which I started learning towards the Q3 of 2019, and it has been fun all through with a rich community of junior, mid-level and senior developers that made it a smooth experience for me. If you have any suggestions and/or comments on this project or anything related, you can contact me at [adelekeadenijio@gmail.com](mailto:adelekeadenijio@gmail.com) or [@eazylaykzy](https://twitter.com/eazylaykzy) on Twitter. Thanks for checking it out.

## Major Issue

The major problem I had was during my implementation of [Nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/)'s mail sending API, I look up Google, and search for the whole Stackoverflow related questions, but none of the answers fit my use case, took me a couple of days before I finally got it fixed. I did answered my own question related to this on Stackoverflow, if anyone is willing to check it out or probably faced with the same issue as me: [OPTIONS net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED + The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource (Reason: CORS request did not succeed)
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59318331/options-neterr-connection-refused-the-same-origin-policy-disallows-reading-t).
